# apogee-gc

This repository contains the script needed to perform the chemical comparison study of accreted and in situ Galactic Globular Clusters from Horta et al (2020) https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.493.3363H/abstract. The code has been written for personal use only, and therefore is not up to scratch for public use. A more thorough and more manageable version is currently in the pipeline, and will become available on this repository in due time
