# apogee-gc

This repository contains the script needed to perform the chemical comparison study of accreted and in situ Galactic Globular Clusters from Horta et al (2020) https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.493.3363H/abstract. The main script of code is contained in the "GC_apogee_finder.ipynb" jupyter notebook. The code can be applied to any APOGEE data release (or any other data on the Milky Way).
